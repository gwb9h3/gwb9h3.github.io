                    <p1>Hi, my name is Grady bice and I am a Junior at UMKC. I am currently working towards a 
                        bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on back-end programing. I am involved 
                        on campus as a Resident Assistant in the dorms and a Lifeguard in the Rec Center. Some of my 
                        goals are to get more job experience in the field, work more on group coding projects, and become 
                        more proficient in coding languages widely used today.

            <p1 class="education_child">In highschool I took two classes through a college in the schools program through the University of Minnesota.
                I then graduated highschool in 2020 and decided to go to South Dakota State University to take general education classes and some animal science courses. After my first year there I 
                took a gap year to decide what major to persue while making money to pay for my education. I then chose UMKC as my next school and decided to work towards 
                a degree in Computer Science.<br>
